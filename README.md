## About Me

I am currently a senior at Arizona State University working towards a BS in Graphic Information Technology (GIT for short).
So what's GIT? I like to think of it as the perfect mix between Graphical Knowledge and Technical application of that knowledge. In other words, Front End!
Many of the classes I have taken utilize the fundamentals of art and design by the creation of real world projects.
Some of my repos are school projects that I have embelished well beyond the requirenments of the class, I've made this a habit over the years.
