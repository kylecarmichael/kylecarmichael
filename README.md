## About Me

Right now I am in my third year at Arizona State University going after a BS in Graphic Information Technology (GIT for short).
What's GIT? I like to think of it as the perfect mix between Graphical Knowledge and Technical application of that knowledge.
Many of the classes I have taken utilize the fundamentals of art and design by the creation of real world projects.
Some of my repos are school projects that I have embelished well beyond the requirenments of the class, I've made this a habit over the years.

## What am I working on right now?

Currently I am working on a school project creating a website with object oriented JavaScript code. 
This website is a kind of To-Do list for movies and shows that we want to watch but can't seem to find the time for.
I already have plans for how to improve the site beyond the course requirenments by implementing CRUD and Date objects to remind how long ago the item was added to the list.

## What am I confident working with?

My most used languages/tools, I am very certain I could create/ find out how to create my desired outcome
-HTML
-CSS
-Vanilla JS
-SCSS
-BootStrap 5

## What am I learning next

-Swift
